# Workday Scheduler

## An interactive Workday Scheduler to organize your day.

The Workday Scheduler utilizes Moment.js to display the day of the week and current day. Standard work day hour slots from 9am to 5pm are available for user input of important meetings or events throughout your day. The hours are even color coded to represent the past, present and current hours in real time.

## Usage

* Future Hour - Green color with black text.

Simply click the hour block you'd like to add an event, appointment or meeting. Click the blue save button to save the item to the appointed hour. Even when you refresh, your input is saved.
